OTR Series Assistant
====================

Track the series you watch. Mainly developed for [OnlineTVRecorder](http://www.onlinetvrecorder.com), but you can just use it to monitor which episodes you have seen.

It uses the series information from [TheTVDB.com](http://www.thetvdb.com) and the [Default icon set](http://www.defaulticon.com/) from [interactivemania](http://www.interactivemania.com/).

Currently the language is German and the program works only on Linux.


TODO:
-----
* Set language (global and per series)
* cross-platform (save data in respective user directory)
* delete series
* update series information
* integrate OTR functionality (e.g. search episodes on mirrors)
